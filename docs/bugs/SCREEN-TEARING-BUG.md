# Screen Tearing Bug — JCEF OSR

**Status**: Recurring — mitigations applied, not confirmed fixed  
**Scope**: JCEF Off-Screen Rendering (OSR) mode in the chat panel  
**Affected area**: `ChatConsolePanel.kt`, `ChatContainer.ts`, `ChatController.ts`, `MessageBubble.ts`

---

## Problem Description

During streaming (agent response output), the JCEF chat panel exhibits visual tearing, flickering,
or stale-frame artifacts. Content appears to "jump" or "flash" as new text arrives. The issue is
specific to JCEF's Off-Screen Rendering mode where Chromium renders to an off-screen buffer that
Swing composites into the panel — any desync between DOM updates, scroll changes, and buffer
refresh causes visible tearing.

The bug is **recurring** because any code change that increases DOM mutation frequency, adds
synchronous layout-forcing operations, or disrupts the rendering pipeline timing can re-trigger it.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

JCEF OSR tearing happens when:

1. **DOM mutations trigger synchronous forced layouts** — writing `scrollTop` forces the browser to
   compute layout immediately (a "forced reflow"). During streaming, if this happens multiple times
   per frame, the compositor can't keep up with the buffer refreshes.

2. **MutationObserver cascades** — one mutation triggers an observer that creates new DOM nodes,
   which triggers the same or another observer, creating a feedback loop within a single frame.

3. **Frame rate mismatch** — if the CEF frame rate is too low relative to the DOM update rate,
   completed frames get skipped and the user sees stale content.

4. **CSS smooth scroll conflicts** — CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` causes the browser to animate
   scroll position over time, conflicting with rapid programmatic `scrollTop` changes during
   streaming.

## Architecture: Rendering Pipeline During Streaming

### Lifecycle

```
startStreaming()                               finishResponse()
     │                                              │
     ├── setFrameRate(60)                           ├── setFrameRate(30)
     ├── repaintTimer.start()  (200ms invalidate)   ├── repaintTimer.stop()
     └── setStreaming(true, false)  [disable smooth] └── restore smooth-scroll preference
```

### Per-token flow

```
Kotlin appendText()
  └── executeJs("ChatController.appendAgentText(...)")
        └── JS: bubble.appendStreamingText(text)    ← accumulates text, schedules rAF
              └── rAF: renderMarkdown()             ← innerHTML replacement
                    └── MutationObserver fires       ← observes childList + subtree
                          └── rAF: scrollIfNeeded() ← writes scrollTop (debounced)
```

### Key invariants

- **One scroll write per rAF** — the `_scrollRAF` gate in `ChatContainer` ensures only one
  `scrollIfNeeded()` runs per animation frame, regardless of how many mutations occurred.
- **No smooth scroll during streaming** — `setStreaming(true, false)` disables CSS smooth scroll.
- **Programmatic bottom-lock is always instant** — `scrollIfNeeded()`, `forceScroll()`, and
  `compensateScroll()` all go through `_scrollToInstant()` even when smooth scrolling is enabled.
- **CEF invalidation safety net** — `repaintTimer` fires `cef.invalidate()` every 200ms during
  streaming, plus throttled per-`executeJs` invalidation (50ms) catches inter-timer gaps.
- **No code block decoration during streaming** — `_setupCodeBlocks()` skips `<pre>` elements
  inside `message-bubble[streaming]` to avoid DOM churn.

## Fix History

### Fix 1 — Original fix (`147c74af`)

**4 compounding issues addressed:**

1. **ResizeObserver synchronous scrollTop** — `ResizeObserver` callback was writing
   `scrollTop = scrollHeight` synchronously on every resize event. Fixed by debouncing through
   a shared `_scrollRAF` rAF gate (coalesce to 1 update per frame).

2. **CSS smooth scroll conflict** — `scroll-behavior: smooth` was active during streaming,
   causing animated scroll to fight with programmatic `scrollTop` changes. Fixed by disabling
   smooth scroll during streaming via `setStreaming(true, false)`.

3. **Low idle frame rate** — `IDLE_FRAME_RATE` was 10fps (100ms frame time), causing stale-frame
   tearing during manual scroll between streaming bursts. Raised to 30fps (33ms).

4. **No forced repaint** — No CEF invalidation safety net. Added `repaintTimer` that calls
   `cef.invalidate()` every 200ms during streaming to force OSR buffer refresh.

### Fix 2 — Autoscroll stutter fix (`f8eb82f5`)

Added `_scrollToInstant()` so programmatic bottom-locking can temporarily set
`scroll-behavior: auto`, perform the scroll, then restore the previous CSS setting. This now backs
`scrollIfNeeded()`, `forceScroll()`, and `compensateScroll()`, preventing stutter loops when smooth
scroll is re-enabled after streaming. During streaming this is a noop since behavior is already
`'auto'`.

### Fix 3 — DOM churn + invalidation throttle (this commit)

**3 issues addressed:**

1. **`_setupCodeBlocks()` mutation loop** (critical) — The `_copyObs` MutationObserver called
   `_setupCodeBlocks()` which processed `<pre>` elements inside streaming bubbles. The selector
   `pre:not(.streaming)` checked for a `.streaming` CSS class on `<pre>`, but the streaming
   attribute is on `<message-bubble>`, not `<pre>`. So during streaming:
   - rAF renders markdown → creates `<pre>` elements
   - `_copyObs` fires → `_setupCodeBlocks()` adds copy/wrap/scratch buttons
   - Next token → `renderMarkdown()` replaces innerHTML → destroys buttons
   - `_copyObs` fires again → re-adds buttons
   - This mutation loop created continuous DOM churn and layout thrashing.

   **Fix**: Changed selector to skip any `<pre>` inside `message-bubble[streaming]` using
   `pre.closest('message-bubble[streaming]')`. Buttons are only added after `finalize()`.

2. **Redundant synchronous scroll in `appendAgentText()`** — `ChatController.appendAgentText()`
   called `this._container()?.scrollIfNeeded()` synchronously after `appendStreamingText()`.
   But `appendStreamingText()` only schedules a rAF — the text hasn't rendered yet, so
   `scrollHeight` is stale. The `MutationObserver` + `ResizeObserver` on `ChatContainer` already
   handle post-render scrolling. The synchronous call was just wasted layout work.

   **Fix**: Removed the synchronous `scrollIfNeeded()` call from `appendAgentText()`.

3. **200ms repaint timer gaps** — With 59+ `executeJs` call sites (tool chips, sub-agents, turn
   stats, nudges, queued messages), JS executions can bunch between 200ms timer ticks, leaving
   DOM changes without a forced CEF repaint for up to 200ms.

   **Fix**: Added throttled per-`executeJs` `cef.invalidate()` during streaming (50ms throttle
   window). The repaintTimer remains as a 200ms safety net; the per-executeJs invalidation catches
   rapid bursts of JS updates.

## Potential Future Regression Vectors

When modifying the streaming pipeline, watch for:

1. **New MutationObservers on `_messages`** — any observer that modifies DOM during streaming
   risks creating a mutation loop. Always check for `message-bubble[streaming]` before adding nodes.

2. **Synchronous `scrollTop` writes** — never write `scrollTop` directly during streaming outside
   the `_scrollRAF` gate. Use `scrollIfNeeded()` for observer-driven autoscroll, or
   `_scrollToInstant()`-backed helpers for explicit snap-to-bottom operations.

3. **New `executeJs` calls during streaming** — each call now triggers throttled invalidation,
   but excessive calls still add EDT overhead via `pushJsEvent()`. Batch when possible.

4. **CSS `scroll-behavior` changes** — never set `scroll-behavior: smooth` during streaming.
   The `setStreaming(true, false)` call at stream start handles this.

5. **MonitorSwitchRecovery** — after a confirmed monitor/display change, it refreshes JCEF OSR
   and the chat panel replays the DOM from Kotlin state once streaming is idle. False positives
   during streaming could still be catastrophic, so keep the fingerprint gate tight and preserve
   the deferred replay behavior.

6. **Frame rate changes** — don't lower `STREAMING_FRAME_RATE` (60) or `IDLE_FRAME_RATE` (30)
   without testing for tearing.
