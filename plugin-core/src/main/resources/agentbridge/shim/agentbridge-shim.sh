#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# AgentBridge command shim.
#
# Installed under multiple names (cat, head, grep, egrep, fgrep, rg, git, ...) in a
# directory that the plugin prepends to PATH for every ACP agent subprocess.
# When an agent's shell invokes one of those names, this script runs instead of
# the real binary.
#
# Behaviour:
#   1. POST the argv to the in-IDE shim controller (/shim-exec) on localhost.
#   2. If the controller returns HTTP 200, the body is "EXIT N\n<stdout-bytes>" —
#      print the stdout and exit with N.
#   3. Otherwise (no port set, missing token, network/timeout, controller says
#      passthrough), exec the real binary with PATH stripped of the shim dir so
#      we never recurse.
#
# Robustness rules:
#   - Use only bash builtins for our own parsing — any external tool we use might
#     itself be a shimmed name (e.g. `head`, `grep`).
#   - Take the absolute curl path from REAL_PATH so our curl call never recurses.
#   - Any error in the redirect path silently falls through to the real binary;
#     the agent must always get a working command.
