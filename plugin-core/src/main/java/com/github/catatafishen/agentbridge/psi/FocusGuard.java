/**
 * Prevents programmatic focus changes during MCP tool execution from stealing focus
 * away from the chat prompt.
 *
 * <p><b>The problem.</b> When the chat is focused (JCEF holds keyboard focus), a tool
 * may call Swing APIs like {@code FileEditorManager.openFile(vf, false)} or
 * {@code navigate(false)}. Even though {@code focusEditor=false} is requested, Swing
 * frequently moves keyboard focus to the newly created editor because JCEF focus is
 * invisible to the Java {@code KeyboardFocusManager}. A 150ms delayed alarm then
 * restores focus — but during that window the user's in-flight keystrokes land in
 * the editor instead of the chat prompt.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix.</b> While a tool is running AND chat was focused at tool start, this
 * guard listens for {@code focusOwner} changes. When focus moves away to a component
 * that is NOT inside the chat tool window AND the change was not triggered by a user
 * input event (mouse click / key press), the guard synchronously requests focus back
 * to the originally focused chat component. Because the reclaim happens inside the
 * property-change dispatch — before any {@link java.awt.event.KeyEvent} is delivered
 * to the new component — typed characters can never leak into the editor.
 *
 * <p><b>Reclaim fires at most once per tool call.</b> If {@code requestFocusInWindow()}
 * on the JCEF component resolves to a component that is not exactly {@code chatFocusOwner}
 * (possible when JCEF routes focus to a parent or sibling component internally), a second
 * invocation of this listener would also pass the checks and fire another reclaim,
 * creating a focus ping-pong that starves the EDT of mouse/paint events and freezes the
 * JCEF panel. The {@code hasReclaimed} flag ensures we call {@code requestFocusInWindow()}
 * at most once — subsequent focus changes are left to the existing 150ms restore alarm.
 *
 * <p><b>User-initiated focus changes are respected.</b> The guard inspects the AWT
 * event currently being dispatched; if it is a {@link InputEvent} (user click or
 * keystroke) the focus change is allowed through. This preserves the ability to
 * click away to an editor during a long-running tool (e.g. build).
 *
 * <p>Install via {@link #install(Project)} on the EDT; call {@link #uninstall()} in
 * the tool-call finally block. Both methods are idempotent and safe to call from any
 * thread — they self-dispatch to the EDT.
