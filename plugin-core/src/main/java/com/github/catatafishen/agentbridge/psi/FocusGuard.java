/**
 * Prevents programmatic focus changes during MCP tool execution from stealing focus
 * away from the chat prompt.
 *
 * <p><b>The problem.</b> When the chat is focused (JCEF holds keyboard focus), a tool
 * may call Swing APIs like {@code FileEditorManager.openFile(vf, false)} or
 * {@code navigate(false)}. Even though {@code focusEditor=false} is requested, Swing
 * frequently moves keyboard focus to the newly created editor because JCEF focus is
 * invisible to the Java {@code KeyboardFocusManager}. A 150ms delayed alarm then
 * restores focus — but during that window the user's in-flight keystrokes land in
 * the editor instead of the chat prompt.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix.</b> This guard uses a {@link java.beans.VetoableChangeListener} on
 * the {@value #FOCUS_OWNER_PROPERTY} property of {@link KeyboardFocusManager}. When a programmatic
 * focus change attempts to move focus away from the chat tool window to a component in
 * the <em>same</em> IDE main frame (editors, other tool windows), the guard throws a
 * {@link java.beans.PropertyVetoException} — <b>preventing the focus change entirely</b>.
 * Focus never leaves the chat component, so zero keystrokes can leak.
 *
 * <p><b>Targeted veto, not blanket.</b> The guard only vetoes focus changes to components
 * in the same {@link Window} as the chat tool window (i.e., the IDE main frame). Focus
 * changes to dialog windows, popups, completion lookups, and other separate windows are
 * allowed through. This prevents interference with IDE plumbing that opens modal dialogs
 * or popup menus during tool execution.
 *
 * <p><b>User-initiated focus changes are respected.</b> The guard inspects the AWT
 * event currently being dispatched; if it is a {@link java.awt.event.InputEvent} (user
 * click or keystroke) the focus change is allowed through. This preserves the ability to
 * click away to an editor during a long-running tool (e.g. build).
 *
 * <p><b>Circuit breaker.</b> If the guard vetoes more than {@value #MAX_VETOES} focus
 * changes in a single lifecycle, it disables itself to prevent unbounded veto storms
 * from degrading IDE responsiveness. This is a safety net — under normal operation,
 * a tool execution triggers at most 2-4 focus changes (editor open, tab creation).
 *
 * <p>Install via {@link #install(Project)} on the EDT; call {@link #uninstall()} in
 * the tool-call finally block. Both methods are idempotent and safe to call from any
 * thread — they self-dispatch to the EDT.
