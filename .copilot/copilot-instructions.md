<!-- IDE Agent for Copilot: plugin instructions (do not remove this line) -->
You are running inside an IntelliJ IDEA plugin with access to 56 IDE tools.

## Tool Overview

**Files:** `intellij_read_file` (use `start_line`/`end_line` for partial reads), `intellij_write_file` (use `old_str`+
`new_str` for edits — never rewrite full files)
**Code search (AST):** `search_symbols`, `find_references`, `get_file_outline`, `get_class_outline`
**Commands:** `run_command` (one-shot), `run_in_terminal` (interactive/long-running)

## Best Practices

1. **Read efficiently** — use `start_line`/`end_line`; only read full files when you need the complete picture.

2. **After editing** — check `--- Highlights (auto) ---` in every write response. Fix errors before editing other files.
   No need to call `get_highlights` separately. **Clean as you code:** also fix pre-existing warnings in the same file
   (unused imports, redundant casts, missing annotations, etc.) — not just issues caused by your change.

3. **Multiple edits** — set `auto_format=false` when making 3+ sequential edits; call `format_code` + `optimize_imports`
   once at the end. Note: `auto_format` removes imports it considers unused — add imports and the code using them in the
   same edit.

4. **`old_str` match failures** — run `format_code` on the file first, then re-read it.

5. **Workspace** — all temp files, plans, and notes go in `.agent-work/` inside the project root (git-ignored). Never
   write outside the project.

6. **Search** — prefer `search_text` over grep; it reads live editor buffers. Prefer code intelligence tools (
   `search_symbols`, `find_references`) over text search for symbols.

7. **Testing** — use `run_tests` (not `run_command`); results appear in the IntelliJ test runner panel. Discover tests
   with
   `list_tests`.

8. **Git** — always use the built-in git tools (`git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_commit`, etc.). Never use `run_command`
   for git — shell git bypasses IntelliJ's VCS layer and causes editor buffer desync.

9. **Undo** — use the `undo` tool to revert bad edits. `auto_format=true` counts as 2 undo steps.

10. **Verification order** (lightest first): auto-highlights → `get_compilation_errors` → `build_project` (only before
    committing).

11. **Grammar (GrazieInspection)** — `apply_quickfix` not supported; use `intellij_write_file` instead.

## Fixing Issues Workflow

When asked to "fix all issues" or "fix the whole project":

1. Run `run_inspections()` for a full overview. Group by **problem type** (not file).
2. Fix **one problem type at a time** across all affected files.
3. `format_code` + `optimize_imports` → `build_project` → commit with a descriptive message.
4. **Stop and ask** before moving to the next category.

Priority: compilation errors > warnings > style > grammar. Skip grammar unless requested. Skip generated files.

## Key Principles

- Related changes → one commit. Unrelated changes → separate commits.
- If SonarQube for IDE is available, run `run_sonarqube_analysis` in addition to `run_inspections`.

## Quick-Reply Buttons

Append `[quick-reply: ...]` at the end of **every** response that asks a question, presents options, or needs
confirmation before continuing. Example: `[quick-reply: Yes | No | Show me first]`

# Project Development Guidelines

> Project-specific conventions for the IntelliJ Copilot Plugin. Tool usage rules are provided by the MCP server
> at initialization. See `PROJECT-SPEC.md` for full architecture details.

---

## Project Context

- IntelliJ plugin integrating GitHub Copilot with MCP tools for code intelligence
- Written in **Java 21**, targets IntelliJ 2024.3–2025.2, built with Gradle
- Three modules: `plugin-core` (UI + services), `mcp-server` (tool definitions), `integration-tests`
- ACP protocol via Copilot CLI, MCP via stdio server, PSI bridge via HTTP

---

## Commits

Use **conventional commits**:

- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `refactor:` — code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `chore:` — build, CI, or tooling changes
- `test:` — adding or fixing tests

**Group related changes as logical units** — may span multiple files. Unrelated changes get separate commits.
**Build must pass** before committing.

---

## IntelliJ Platform Rules

### Threading

- **Always** wrap PSI access in `ReadAction.compute()` or `ReadAction.run()`
- **Always** wrap file writes in `WriteAction.compute()` or `WriteAction.run()`
- **Never** nest read/write actions
- Use `invokeLater()` for UI operations

### API Usage

- **Never** use deprecated JetBrains APIs — they get flagged on the JetBrains Marketplace
- **Never** use experimental APIs (`@ApiStatus.Experimental`) — they can change without notice
- **Never** use internal APIs (`@ApiStatus.Internal`, `com.intellij.openapi.util.internal.*`) — they are unsupported and
  get flagged on the Marketplace
- When a deprecated API is encountered while editing, replace it with its recommended replacement

### Null Safety

- Keep defensive null checks even if marked `@NotNull` (runtime ≠ compile-time)

---

## Code Quality

### Clean As You Code

When editing a file, fix **all** issues in that file — not just those caused by your change. Unused imports, redundant
casts, missing annotations, dead code, pre-existing warnings — fix them in the same edit. This keeps the codebase
progressively cleaner with every touch.

### Warnings and Suppressions

- **Do not suppress warnings** — fix the root cause instead
- No `@SuppressWarnings` as a first resort
- No disabling inspection rules to lower the count
- Investigate every warning: understand WHY it's flagged, then fix the underlying problem

**The only acceptable suppressions:**

1. Required by framework (override signature, interface implementation)
2. Defensive null checks that IntelliJ marks as "always true" but protect against runtime edge cases

### Priority Order

1. **Compilation errors** — fix immediately
2. **Warnings** — fix all
3. **Style issues** — fix if straightforward
4. **Grammar** — only if requested

### Common Issues & Proper Fixes

| Issue                     | ✅ Fix                                                               | ❌ Don't                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Duplicate string literals | Extract to `private static final` constants                         | Suppress                 |
| Cognitive complexity      | Extract methods, simplify conditions, reduce nesting                | Suppress                 |
| Empty catch blocks        | Log the exception or document why it's safe to ignore               | Suppress                 |
| `InterruptedException`    | Always call `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` after catching     | Suppress                 |
| Unused parameters/methods | Remove if truly unused; keep only if required by interface/override | Suppress private methods |
| Deprecated JetBrains API  | Replace with the recommended alternative                            | Keep using it            |

## Deploying to Main IDE

The sandbox IDE (`runIde`) picks up code changes automatically. The **main IDE does not** — you must manually rebuild
and deploy after each change.

**After every code change, run these 3 commands:**

```bash
cd /path/to/ide-agent-for-copilot

# 1. Build the plugin zip
./gradlew :plugin-core:buildPlugin -x buildSearchableOptions --quiet

# 2. Remove the old installed plugin
rm -rf ~/.local/share/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.3/plugin-core

# 3. Extract the new one (use latest zip)
unzip -q "$(ls -t plugin-core/build/distributions/*.zip | head -1)" -d ~/.local/share/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.3/
```

Then tell the user to **restart the main IDE**.

> **Key points:**
> - Install path: `~/.local/share/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.3/plugin-core/` — no `plugins/` subfolder
    (Toolbox-managed layout)
> - **Must** `rm -rf` the old folder first — otherwise stale JARs remain
> - `-x buildSearchableOptions` is required — that task tries to launch an IDE which conflicts with the running one
> - Zip filename includes a commit hash (e.g. `plugin-core-0.2.0-2bb9797.zip`), so always use `ls -t ... | head -1`

## Implementation Decisions

- **Build**: Gradle 8.x with IntelliJ Platform Plugin 2.x
- **Protocol**: ACP (via Copilot CLI), MCP (stdio server)
- **Authentication**: GitHub OAuth via Copilot CLI
- **Development**: Sandbox-first with `./restart-sandbox.sh` for fast reload
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, unit tests via `run_tests`
- **All code**: Java 21. Kotlin shims only when IntelliJ API requires it.
