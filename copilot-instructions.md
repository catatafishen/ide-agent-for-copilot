## 1) Project Context

- IntelliJ plugin integrating GitHub Copilot with 54 MCP tools for code intelligence
- Written in **Java 21**, targets IntelliJ 2024.3-2025.2, built with Gradle
- Three modules: `plugin-core` (UI + services), `mcp-server` (tool definitions), `integration-tests`
- ACP protocol via Copilot CLI, MCP via stdio server, PSI bridge via HTTP

---

## 2) IntelliJ Platform Rules

### Threading

- ✅ **Always** wrap PSI access in `ReadAction.compute()` or `ReadAction.run()`
- ✅ **Always** wrap file writes in `WriteAction.compute()` or `WriteAction.run()`
- ❌ **Never** nest read/write actions
- ✅ Use `invokeLater()` for UI operations

### Null Checks

- ✅ **Keep defensive null checks** even if marked `@NotNull` (runtime != compile-time)
- ✅ Suppress with `@SuppressWarnings({"ConstantValue", "DataFlowIssue"})` if IntelliJ complains

---

## 3) Code Quality Standards

### Priority Order

1. **Compilation errors** (must fix immediately)
2. **Warnings** (fix all when asked to "clean up")
3. **Style issues** (fix if easy)
4. **Grammar** (LOW priority — only if requested)

### Tool-Specific Quirks

**GrazieInspection (Grammar)**:

- ❌ Does NOT support `apply_quickfix`
- ✅ Must manually edit with `intellij_write_file`
- If 50+ grammar issues, ask user first

**SonarLint**:

- Shows in `get_highlights` only (not `run_inspections`)
- Open file in editor first: `open_in_editor` → `get_highlights(path)`

**Cognitive Complexity**:

- When writing NEW code: check `get_highlights` after each method
- If "Cognitive Complexity" warning: refactor IMMEDIATELY by extracting methods

### Commit Strategy

**Group RELATED changes as logical units** — may span multiple files:

- ✅ "Fix unused parameters across 3 test files" (related problem)
- ✅ "Refactor authentication flow" (4 files, one feature)
- ❌ "Fix random issues in 5 unrelated files" (separate commits)
- ❌ "Grammar + refactoring + bug fix" (3 different concerns)

**Build must pass** before committing.

---

## 4) Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Split related refactoring across commits

```
Commit 1: Class A (broken build)
Commit 2: Class B (still broken)
Commit 3: Class C (finally works)
```

### ✅ Keep related changes atomic

```
Commit 1: All 3 classes → "refactor: extract common interface"
Build passes, logical change is complete
```

---

### ❌ Mix unrelated fixes in one commit

```
One commit: grammar + null checks + unused params
```

### ✅ Separate commits per problem type

```
Commit 1: "fix: unused parameters in test mocks"
Commit 2: "fix: add null safety checks"
```

---

## 5) Fixing Inspection Issues (SonarQube, IntelliJ, Qodana)

### Philosophy: Fix Root Causes, Don't Suppress

**When asked to fix inspection issues:**

✅ **DO**:

- **Investigate thoroughly** — understand WHY the issue is flagged
- **Fix the underlying problem** — refactor code to eliminate the issue
- **Test your fix** — ensure it doesn't break functionality
- **Question false positives** — if genuinely wrong, document why and get confirmation

❌ **DON'T**:

- **Suppress warnings** without investigation
- **Add `@SuppressWarnings` as first resort**
- **Disable inspection rules** to make count go down
- **Assume all issues are false positives**

### Common Issues & Proper Fixes

**Duplicate string literals**:

- ✅ Extract to private static final constants
- ❌ Don't suppress — it's real technical debt

**Cognitive complexity**:

- ✅ Extract methods, simplify conditions, reduce nesting
- ❌ Don't suppress — refactor the complex logic

**Empty catch blocks**:

- ✅ Log the exception or add comment explaining why it's safe to ignore
- ❌ Don't suppress — either handle it or document why it's intentional

**InterruptedException**:

- ✅ Always call `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` after catching
- ❌ Don't suppress — this is critical for thread safety

**Unused parameters/methods**:

- ✅ Remove if truly unused; keep if required by interface/override
- ✅ Add `@SuppressWarnings("unused")` ONLY if kept for API compatibility
- ❌ Don't suppress private methods that can be deleted

### When Suppression IS Appropriate

Only suppress when:

1. **Required by framework** (override signature, interface implementation)
2. **Public API** that must be kept for backward compatibility
3. **Defensive code** that IntelliJ marks as "always true/false" but protects against edge cases
4. **Known false positive** that has been investigated and documented

Example of appropriate suppression:

```java

@Override
@SuppressWarnings("unused") // Required by SomeInterface contract
public void methodUsedByFramework(Object param) {
    // Framework calls this reflectively
}
```

### Workflow for Fixing Issues

1. **Run inspections**: `run_inspections` to see all issues
2. **Understand the issue**: Read the description, check the flagged code
3. **Fix properly**: Refactor code to eliminate root cause
4. **Verify**: Re-run inspections to confirm issue is gone
5. **Test**: Build project to ensure no breakage
6. **Commit**: Group related fixes in logical commits

---

## 6) Deploying to Main IDE

The sandbox IDE (`runIde`) picks up code changes automatically. The **main IDE does not** — you must manually rebuild
and deploy after each change.

**After every code change, run these 3 commands:**

```bash
cd /path/to/ide-agent-for-copilot

# 1. Build the plugin zip
./gradlew :plugin-core:buildPlugin -x buildSearchableOptions --quiet

# 2. Remove the old installed plugin
rm -rf ~/.local/share/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.3/plugin-core

# 3. Extract the new one (use latest zip)
unzip -q "$(ls -t plugin-core/build/distributions/*.zip | head -1)" -d ~/.local/share/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.3/
```

Then tell the user to **restart the main IDE**.

> **Key points:**
> - Install path: `~/.local/share/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2025.3/plugin-core/` — no `plugins/` subfolder (Toolbox-managed
    layout)
> - **Must** `rm -rf` the old folder first — otherwise stale JARs remain
> - `-x buildSearchableOptions` is required — that task tries to launch an IDE which conflicts with the running one
> - Zip filename includes a commit hash (e.g. `plugin-core-0.2.0-2bb9797.zip`), so always use `ls -t ... | head -1`

---

## 7) Implementation Decisions (Feb 2026)

- **Build**: Gradle 8.x with IntelliJ Platform Plugin 2.x
- **Protocol**: ACP (via Copilot CLI), MCP (stdio server)
- **Authentication**: GitHub OAuth via Copilot CLI
- **Development**: Sandbox-first with `./restart-sandbox.sh` for fast reload
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, 89 unit tests passing
- **All code**: Java 21. Kotlin shims only when IntelliJ API requires it.

---

## 8) Tool Preferences

### Always prefer IntelliJ MCP tools over generic CLI tools

The MCP server provides IntelliJ-integrated tools that read from editor buffers (always up-to-date, even unsaved
changes). **Always use these instead of generic alternatives:**

| ❌ Don't use         | ✅ Use instead                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `view` (file)       | `intellij_read_file`                        |
| `cat`/`head`/`tail` | `intellij_read_file`                        |
| `grep` / `ripgrep`  | `search_text` or `search_symbols`           |
| `glob`              | `list_project_files`                        |
| `create` (file)     | `create_file`                               |
| `edit` (file)       | `intellij_write_file`                       |
| `sed`               | `intellij_write_file`                       |
| `bash`              | `run_command` (flushes buffers first)       |
| `bash: git ...`     | `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_commit` etc. |

### Why this matters

- Editor buffers may have unsaved changes that disk-based tools miss
- IntelliJ tools respect project structure and excludes (build/, .gradle/)
- Symbol search uses IDE indexes — faster and more accurate than text grep
- Git tools sync with IntelliJ's VCS, avoiding buffer desync
- `run_command` and git tools flush editor buffers to disk before running, so CLI tools see current content
- `bash` does NOT flush buffers — commands may see stale files

### Exceptions

- Use `run_command` for build commands (`gradlew`), process management, or system operations
- Use `run_command` for commands that don't have an IntelliJ tool equivalent

### ⚠ Known Limitation: Platform-Provided Tools Bypass Our Controls

Copilot CLI injects built-in tools (`view`, `grep`, `glob`, `edit`, `create`, `bash`) that read/write
directly from disk, bypassing IntelliJ editor buffers. **We cannot remove these tools** due to a
[Copilot CLI bug](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/1485) — the `tools/remove` capability
is not implemented.

**What we do:**

- Deny permission via ACP `request_permission` when the agent asks to use them
- Send guidance messages redirecting to `intellij-code-tools-*` equivalents
- Block `bash`, `cat`, `sed`, `grep`, `find` in `run_command` abuse detection

**What we can't control:**

- The Copilot platform may invoke these tools directly without a permission request
- Instructions and denials are best-effort — the agent may still occasionally use disk-based tools
- This can cause stale reads (editor has newer content) or write conflicts (disk write overwrites buffer)

**Impact:** Occasional buffer desync. Mitigated by `saveAllDocuments()` in `run_command`, `run_in_terminal`,
and all git operations, which flush buffers to disk before execution.
